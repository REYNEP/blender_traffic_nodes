# update
Now there is load_and_reg.py file, which is mainly inspired by jacques Lucke's auto_load.py Blender Addon Auto Registration Module, I did some changes of my own to make it faster
Anyone is Welcome to use it. ðŸ˜„

# blender_traffic_nodes
I was trying to Create a Traffic System in blender, 
But it Seems Like, Calculating a Middle frame will always end up requiring info on the last frame
SO it kind of will always end up being like a simulation

and Yes we could have done that with Animation Nodes
But I wanted Faster Implementations, So I Made My Approach

Following JacquesLucke, Mainly His Animation Nodes Copde from 2014-15 is helping me so far so good
Simulation will be done with c++
Releases will have Binary Files for those c++ code
