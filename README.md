# blender_traffic_nodes
I was trying to Create a Traffic System in blender, 
But it Seems Like, Calculating a Middle frame will always end up requiring info on the last frame
SO it kind of will always end up being like a simulation

and Yes we could have done that with Animation Nodes
But I wanted Faster Implementations, So I Made My Approach

Following JacquesLucke, Mainly His Animation Nodes Copde from 2014-15 is helping me so far so good
Simulation will be done with c++
Releases will have Binary Files
